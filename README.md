Inventory HUD for ESX based on TSRAK esx_inventoryhud made by me and B1G https://github.com/CarlosVergikosk.

Most of the code of the shops was taken from SUKU's suku shops for esx_inventoryhud, although some features were added, like ilegal shop, police shop, price easily changeable on the config, and some other spicy stuff :)

The weapons as items part is made like in disc_inventoryhud, and for that reason it uses disc_ammo in which you can easily remove the disc_base dependency if you want!

This resource should work on ESX 1.2, but I use a version before the 1.2 and after the weight update!

You can get it to work with most of esx_inventoryhud plugins, like trunk, property etc.. Check the js file most things come already pre configured!

Most of the notifications are in Portuguese, so if any kind sould want to translate them, that would be apreciated!

I may give some support, but won't 100% guarantee.

That's pretty much it, this is like the ultimate inventory hud that you can have on your ESX server without breaking or leaving your server unplayable, I'll list the features down below.
